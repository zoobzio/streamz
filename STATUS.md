# Streamz Development Status

## Current State

### Completed Work

#### Clockz Integration (Complete)
- ✅ Replaced internal clock implementation with github.com/zoobzio/clockz v0.0.2
- ✅ Fixed all 21 timing violations across 4 priority groups:
  - Priority 1: DLQ component (2 violations) - now fully testable with deterministic timeouts
  - Priority 2: Service simulators (5 violations) - integration tests now deterministic
  - Priority 3: Rate Limiter example (1 violation) - teaches proper patterns
  - Priority 4: Main Demo (11 violations) - complete consistency
- ✅ All components using timing now accept Clock interface
- ✅ Deterministic testing patterns established throughout codebase
- ✅ No cargo-culting detected - all clock usage genuinely needed

### Active Investigations (Paused)

#### Switch Processor Design Challenge
**Status:** Architectural decision needed
- JOEBOY proposed `RouteResult[T]` wrapper for routing metadata
- **Problem:** Breaks `Result[T]` channel consistency that MOUSE confirmed exists everywhere
- **RAINMAN's finding:** Would require unwrapping adapters, breaks composition
- **Alternatives identified:** 
  - Keep RouteResult with built-in adapters
  - Abandon route metadata for composition priority
  - Multi-channel return patterns

#### Window Processor Composability Issue  
**Status:** Fundamental design problem discovered
- **Current:** Windows return `<-chan Window[T]` (breaks composition)
- **Reality:** Users always want to process windows further (aggregation → alerts/metrics)
- **Problem:** Forces custom processors since Window[T] can't feed standard processors
- **RAINMAN's evidence:** Windows never used as terminals, always intermediate steps
- **Potential solutions:** 
  - `Result[Window[T]]` wrapper (but creates double Result nesting since Window contains `[]Result[T]`)
  - Dual API approach
  - Fundamental redesign

### Core Architectural Question

**Composability vs. Semantic Clarity Trade-off:**
- Strict `Result[T]` consistency enables perfect composition
- Semantic types (Window[T], RouteResult[T]) provide clearer intent but break chains
- Current inconsistency: Windows already break the pattern

### Next Steps Needed

1. **Decision on Switch processor:** RouteResult[T] vs composition-friendly alternatives
2. **Window processor redesign:** Address fundamental composability vs aggregation semantics
3. **Consistency policy:** Decide when semantic breaks are acceptable vs. composition priority

### Package Health

- ✅ All tests passing with deterministic timing
- ✅ Clean clock abstraction throughout
- ✅ No external dependencies beyond clockz
- ⚠️ Composability inconsistencies need resolution
- ⚠️ Examples reference deleted components (Dedupe, Monitor, StreamStats, DroppingBuffer)
