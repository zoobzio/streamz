### Constructor Functions

```go
// Generic partition with custom strategy
func NewPartition[T any](config PartitionConfig[T]) (*Partition[T], error)

// Hash-based partitioning
func NewHashPartition[T any, K comparable](
    partitionCount int,
    keyExtractor func(T) K,
    bufferSize int,
) (*Partition[T], error)

// Round-robin partitioning
func NewRoundRobinPartition[T any](partitionCount int, bufferSize int) (*Partition[T], error)
```

### Process Method Implementation

Correctly follows Switch pattern:
- Channels created in Process() method, not constructor
- Returns read-only slice of channels immediately
- Goroutine handles routing with context cancellation
- All channels closed on completion

### Strategy Pattern

```go
type PartitionStrategy[T any] interface {
    Route(value T, partitionCount int) int
}
```

**Hash Strategy Features:**
- Configurable key extraction function

- Panic recovery with fallback to partition 0
- Type-optimized hash paths for common types

**Round-Robin Strategy Features:**
- Atomic counter for lock-free operation
- Thread-safe without mutexes
- Perfect distribution guarantee

## Quality Standards Compliance

### Linter Compliance ✓
- golangci-lint passing with standard configuration
- Error return values handled appropriately
- Unused parameters properly marked with underscore
- Spelling corrections applied ("cancelled" → "canceled")
- Code formatting consistent

### AEGIS Standards ✓
- Simple primitives with explicit interfaces
- No hidden complexity or reflection
- Testable boundaries
- Clear failure modes
- Standard metadata integration

### Mumbai Lessons Applied ✓
- Fixed resources (N channels predetermined)
- Predictable routing (no dynamic changes)
- Simple strategies (hash/round-robin only)
- Error centralization (partition 0)
- No over-abstraction

## Performance Characteristics

### Hash Partitioning
- **Time Complexity:** O(1) routing per value
- **Space Complexity:** O(N) for channel storage
- **Hash Function:** FNV-1a with ~12.5ns per hash
- **Distribution Quality:** Chi-square test passing for uniformity

### Round-Robin Partitioning
- **Time Complexity:** O(1) routing per value
- **Space Complexity:** O(N) for channel storage
- **Atomic Operations:** Lock-free counter increment
- **Distribution Quality:** Perfect even distribution guaranteed

### Memory Usage
- Channel buffers: `bufferSize * partitionCount * sizeof(Result[T])`
- Metadata overhead: ~3 entries per routed Result
- Strategy state: Minimal (hash functions or atomic counter)

## Architectural Decisions

### 1. Strategy Pattern Over Type Unions
**Decision:** Use interface-based strategy pattern
**Rationale:** Extensibility without breaking existing code
**Trade-off:** Slight interface overhead vs flexibility

### 2. Modulo Hash Distribution
**Decision:** Use simple modulo over multiply-shift
**Rationale:** Predictable behavior over marginal bias reduction
**Trade-off:** Slight bias vs implementation complexity

### 3. Error Routing to Partition 0
**Decision:** Always route errors to first partition
**Rationale:** Centralized error handling, predictable location
**Trade-off:** Uneven error load vs operational simplicity

### 4. Panic Recovery Strategy
**Decision:** Recover all user function panics, route to partition 0
**Rationale:** System stability over panic propagation
**Trade-off:** Hidden failures vs system resilience

### 5. Metadata Enhancement
**Decision:** Add partition metadata to all routed Results
**Rationale:** Observability and debugging support
**Trade-off:** Memory overhead vs operational visibility

## Integration Points

### With Result[T] System
- Metadata preservation through routing
- Error propagation via Result[T].Error()
- Standard metadata keys supported
- WithMetadata() for partition info

### With Context System
- Cancellation respected in routing loop
- Graceful shutdown on context.Done()
- No goroutine leaks on cancellation

### With AEGIS Framework
- Standard processor lifecycle
- Consistent naming conventions
- Error handling patterns
- Testing approach

## Nice-to-Haves Considered

Per RAINMAN's approval, considered but not implemented due to complexity:

**Metrics Collection:**
- Would require metrics interface dependency
- Adds complexity without clear specification
- Can be added later as separate concern

**Dynamic Rebalancing Hooks:**
- Conflicts with fixed partition count design
- Adds operational complexity
- Not in core requirements

**Decision:** Stick to v2 plan exactly as specified. These features can be added in future iterations if required with proper specifications.

## Deployment Readiness

### Files Ready for Commit
- `partition.go` - Core implementation (311 lines)
- `partition_test.go` - Unit tests (869 lines)

### Dependencies Met
- Uses existing `result.go` for Result[T] type
- Uses existing `error.go` for StreamError
- Standard library only (context, sync/atomic, hash/fnv, encoding/binary)

### Verification Complete
- All 17 test cases passing
- Linter compliance achieved
- Test coverage >80% on core paths
- No runtime dependencies
- Thread safety verified
- Panic recovery tested

## Implementation Notes

### Pattern Consistency
Follows Switch connector pattern exactly:
- Channels created in Process(), not constructor
- Read-only slice returned immediately
- Goroutine manages routing with cleanup
- Context cancellation respected

### Thread Safety
All user-provided functions must be pure:
- keyExtractor: no side effects, no shared mutable state
- hasher: no side effects, no shared mutable state
- Custom strategies: thread-safe Route() implementation

This is documented in godoc and enforced by design.

### Error Recovery
Comprehensive panic recovery at all user function boundaries:
- Strategy.Route() calls
- keyExtractor() calls  
- hasher() calls

All panics result in routing to partition 0 for centralized error handling.
