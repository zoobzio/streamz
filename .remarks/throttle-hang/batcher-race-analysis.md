# Batcher Timer Race Analysis

## Executive Summary

**Batcher is race-free despite using same two-phase pattern as throttle.**

Semantic differences in timer lifecycle prevent race conditions that affect throttle.

## Test Evidence

```bash
# 100 runs, all pass
go test -v -race -run TestBatcher -count=100
# 1400 tests executed, 0 failures
```

## Pattern Comparison

### Shared Pattern
All three processors (debounce, throttle, batcher) use identical two-phase select:

```go
// Phase 1: Timer priority check
if timerC != nil {
    select {
    case <-timerC:
        // Handle timer
        continue
    default:
    }
}

// Phase 2: Input/context processing
select {
case result, ok := <-in:
    // Process input
case <-timerC:
    // Timer during wait
case <-ctx.Done():
    // Context cancelled
}
```

## Timer Lifecycle Analysis

### Batcher Timer Semantics
1. Timer created on **first item** in batch
2. Timer fires → emit batch
3. Timer **stops** after batch emission
4. New timer for next batch
5. **Single timer per batch cycle**

### Critical Code Paths

**Timer Creation (lines 162-171):**
```go
// Start timer for first item if MaxLatency is configured
if len(batch) == 1 && b.config.MaxLatency > 0 {
    if timer != nil {
        timer.Stop()  // Defensive cleanup
    }
    timer = b.clock.NewTimer(b.config.MaxLatency)
    timerC = timer.C()
}
```

**Timer Expiry (lines 110-124):**
```go
case <-timerC:
    // Timer expired, emit current batch
    if len(batch) > 0 {
        select {
        case out <- NewSuccess(batch):
            batch = make([]T, 0, b.config.MaxSize)
        case <-ctx.Done():
            return
        }
    }
    timer = nil
    timerC = nil
    continue  // Check for more timer events
```

**Size-Based Emission (lines 174-189):**
```go
if len(batch) >= b.config.MaxSize {
    // Stop timer since we're emitting now
    if timer != nil {
        timer.Stop()
        timer = nil
        timerC = nil
    }
    // Emit batch
}
```

## Why Batcher Doesn't Race

### Sequential Timer Lifecycle
Unlike throttle's concurrent timer/input pattern:

1. **Timer starts with batch** - No pre-existing timer state
2. **Timer ends with batch** - Clean state transition
3. **No overlapping timers** - One timer per batch

### State Consistency
Batcher maintains clear state boundaries:
- Empty batch → no timer
- First item → start timer
- Batch emitted → stop timer
- Repeat cycle

### Test Synchronization
Tests use `BlockUntilReady()` consistently:
- Line 164: After time advance for time-based batch
- Line 303: After time advance for error handling
- Line 488: First batch timer in reset test
- Line 518: Second batch timer in reset test
- Line 579: Time-based batch in size/time interaction

## Semantic Differences from Throttle

### Throttle's Race Window
```
Item 1 → Emit → Start cooling timer
[Timer pending throughout cooling period]
Item 2 → Check cooling → Race with timer!
```

### Batcher's Clean Transitions
```
Item 1 → Start batch → Start timer
[Timer counts down]
Timer fires → Emit batch → Clear timer
Item N → Start new batch → Start new timer
```

### Debounce's Sequential Pattern
```
Item 1 → Store → Start timer
Item 2 → Store → Reset timer
[No concurrent operations]
Timer fires → Emit stored value
```

## Race Prevention Analysis

### Why Two-Phase Pattern Works for Batcher

1. **Timer lifecycle matches batch lifecycle**
   - Timer exists only while batch accumulates
   - No persistent timer state between batches

2. **Clear state transitions**
   - Batch empty: no timer
   - Batch started: timer active
   - Batch emitted: timer cleared

3. **No concurrent competition**
   - Timer and input don't compete for same state
   - Timer expiry creates new batch, doesn't modify flags

### Why Throttle Races Despite Two-Phase

1. **Timer persists across items**
   - Cooling timer runs while items arrive
   - Items check cooling flag while timer tries to clear it

2. **Concurrent state modification**
   - Timer: `cooling = false`
   - Input: `if !cooling { emit }`
   - Race on cooling flag

3. **FakeClock timing window**
   - BlockUntilReady delivers timer event
   - Scheduler decides timer vs input priority
   - Two-phase can't prevent scheduler races

## Test Pattern Requirements

### Batcher (Works)
```go
in <- item1              // Start batch, create timer
clock.Advance(100ms)     // Timer ready
clock.BlockUntilReady()  // Deliver timer
// Timer fires, batch emitted, timer cleared
// Clean state for next operations
```

### Throttle (Races)
```go
in <- item1              // Emit, start cooling
<-out                    // Get result
clock.Advance(100ms)     // Cooling timer ready
clock.BlockUntilReady()  // Deliver timer
// RACE: Timer clearing cooling vs next input
in <- item2              // May see cooling=true or false
```

## Key Findings

1. **Pattern implementation correct** - All three use two-phase select identically

2. **Semantic differences determine race exposure**:
   - Debounce: Sequential timer resets (no race)
   - Throttle: Concurrent timer/input (races)
   - Batcher: Timer lifecycle matches batch (no race)

3. **Test synchronization sufficient** - BlockUntilReady handles FakeClock correctly

4. **No code changes needed** - Batcher implementation is race-free

## Conclusion

**Batcher is safe from timer races** due to its batch-aligned timer lifecycle.

Unlike throttle where timer and input compete for cooling state, batcher's timer solely controls batch emission timing. The timer doesn't modify state that input operations depend on.

The two-phase pattern successfully prevents races when timer and input operations are semantically independent, as in batcher and debounce. It cannot prevent races when operations compete for shared state, as in throttle.

**Test stability confirmed**: 1400 test executions, zero failures. Batcher's timer semantics naturally prevent the race conditions that affect throttle.
