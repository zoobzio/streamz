# Clock Synchronization Test Fixes - Complete

## Summary
Successfully fixed all test synchronization issues by replacing time.Sleep() calls with clock.BlockUntilReady() after clock.Advance() operations. This provides deterministic synchronization with the new clockz library requirements.

4. **testing/integration/result_composability_test.go** - 1 fix
   - Added clock.BlockUntilReady() after clock.Advance() in debounce test

5. **testing/integration/timer_race_test.go** - 1 fix
   - Added clock.BlockUntilReady() after clock.Advance() in debounce race test

## Pattern Applied
Replaced all occurrences of:
```go
clock.Advance(duration)
time.Sleep(duration)
```

With:
```go
clock.Advance(duration)
clock.BlockUntilReady()
```

## Notes
- debounce_test.go already had correct clock.BlockUntilReady() calls
- throttle_chaos_test.go intentionally uses random synchronization for chaos testing - left unchanged
- All other test files already followed proper clock synchronization patterns

## Testing
All changes maintain test semantics while providing deterministic clock synchronization. The BlockUntilReady() method ensures that all clock-dependent operations complete before proceeding, eliminating race conditions in fake clock tests.

## Technical Details
The clockz library requires explicit synchronization after clock advances to ensure deterministic test execution. The BlockUntilReady() method blocks until all pending timer operations triggered by the clock advance have been processed.

This change eliminates the non-deterministic timing issues that could occur with time.Sleep() in fake clock environments, providing reliable and fast test execution.
