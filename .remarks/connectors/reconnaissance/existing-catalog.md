# Streamz Existing Connector Reconnaissance Report

## What's Up

Found 18 active stream processing connectors in the streamz package. Good spread of fundamental stream processing primitives with some advanced stuff mixed in. All connectors work with Result[T] pattern for unified error handling.

Key gaps: no partition/aggregate/retry/dedupe under those names, but some functionality exists under different implementations.

## Getting Technical

### Core Channel Routing
**FanIn**: Merges multiple Result[T] channels into single output stream
- Use case: Collecting results from parallel workers, consolidating multiple sources
- Key characteristics: N-to-1 routing, preserves all items
- Implementation: Simple goroutine per input, WaitGroup coordination

**FanOut**: Distributes single Result[T] to multiple output channels  
- Use case: Broadcasting to multiple consumers, parallel processing pipelines
- Key characteristics: 1-to-N routing, duplicates every item to all outputs
- Implementation: Single distributor goroutine, backpressure affects all

**Switch**: Routes Result[T] to multiple channels based on predicate evaluation
- Use case: Conditional routing, content-based routing, error separation
- Key characteristics: 1-to-N selective routing, lazy channel creation
- Implementation: Predicate-based routing with separate error channel

### Data Transformation
**Mapper**: Synchronous 1-to-1 transformations (In -> Out)
- Use case: Type conversions, simple computations, data formatting
- Key characteristics: Sequential processing, no concurrency overhead
- Implementation: Single goroutine, direct function application

**AsyncMapper**: Concurrent transformations with worker pool
- Use case: CPU-intensive ops, I/O-bound operations, parallel enrichment  
- Key characteristics: Configurable workers, ordered/unordered modes
- Implementation: Worker pool with optional result reordering

**Filter**: Selective pass-through based on predicate
- Use case: Data validation, business rule application, load reduction
- Key characteristics: Drops items that don't match, preserves successful items
- Implementation: Single predicate evaluation per item

### Flow Control
**Throttle**: Leading edge rate limiting (first item passes, then cooldown)
- Use case: Button debouncing, burst protection, API rate limiting
- Key characteristics: Timestamp-based, errors pass through immediately
- Implementation: Mutex-protected last emission tracking

**Debounce**: Trailing edge - emits only after quiet period
- Use case: Search-as-you-type, sensor stabilization, UI event coalescing
- Key characteristics: Only last item emits after inactivity period
- Implementation: Timer-based with proper FakeClock support

**Sample**: Random sampling based on probability (0.0-1.0 rate)
- Use case: Load shedding, statistical sampling, A/B testing
- Key characteristics: Independent probability per item, cryptographic randomness
- Implementation: Simple rand.Float64() comparison

### Buffering and Batching  
**Buffer**: Simple channel buffering for producer/consumer decoupling
- Use case: Smoothing processing speed mismatches, burst handling
- Key characteristics: Pass-through with configurable buffer size
- Implementation: Buffered output channel

**Batcher**: Groups items by size or time constraints
- Use case: Database bulk operations, API call optimization, micro-batching
- Key characteristics: Dual triggers (MaxSize OR MaxLatency), error pass-through
- Implementation: Timer-based with size checking

### Windowing Operations
**TumblingWindow**: Fixed-size, non-overlapping time windows
- Use case: Hourly stats, periodic batch processing, rate calculations
- Key characteristics: Each item belongs to exactly one window
- Implementation: Single ticker, window metadata attachment

**SlidingWindow**: Overlapping time windows with configurable slide interval
- Use case: Rolling averages, smooth trend analysis, pattern detection
- Key characteristics: Items can belong to multiple windows, slide != size
- Implementation: Multiple active windows map, optimization for slide == size

**SessionWindow**: Dynamic windows based on activity gaps (key-based sessions)
- Use case: User session tracking, conversation threading, work pattern analysis
- Key characteristics: Dynamic duration, extends with activity, per-key sessions
- Implementation: Session state map, gap/4 checking frequency

### Utility/Observability
**Tap**: Side-effect execution without modifying stream
- Use case: Logging, metrics collection, debugging, audit trails
- Key characteristics: Observes without interfering, panic recovery
- Implementation: Side effect function with pass-through

**DeadLetterQueue**: Separates success/error streams into two channels
- Use case: Different handling for success vs failure, error isolation
- Key characteristics: Dual output channels, non-consumed channel dropping
- Implementation: Timeout-based channel selection to prevent deadlocks

## What This Means

### Primitive Coverage Analysis
Standard stream processing primitives present:
- ✅ **map**: Mapper, AsyncMapper  
- ✅ **filter**: Filter
- ✅ **fanout/broadcast**: FanOut
- ✅ **fanin/merge**: FanIn
- ✅ **buffer**: Buffer
- ✅ **batch**: Batcher
- ✅ **sample**: Sample
- ✅ **throttle**: Throttle
- ✅ **debounce**: Debounce
- ✅ **window**: TumblingWindow, SlidingWindow, SessionWindow
- ✅ **tap/observe**: Tap
- ✅ **route/switch**: Switch

### Missing Under Expected Names
These exist in other stream processing frameworks but not by name:
- **partition**: Could be implemented via Switch + predicate
- **aggregate**: No dedicated aggregator (would use window + collector pattern)  
- **retry**: No retry connector (would need separate implementation)
- **dedupe**: No deduplication connector 
- **take/limit**: No item count limiting
- **skip**: No item skipping

### Architectural Patterns
All connectors follow consistent patterns:
- Result[T] unified error handling (eliminates dual-channel complexity)
- Context-based cancellation throughout
- Single-goroutine architectures prevent races
- Metadata flow preservation
- Clock interface for deterministic testing

The Result[T] pattern is interesting - it's like Rust's Result type but for Go streams. Eliminates the typical (data chan, error chan) pattern.

### Real-World Impact
This is a solid foundation for stream processing. The Result[T] pattern addresses a major Go streaming pain point. Missing pieces like retry and dedupe are common needs but can be built on top.

The windowing implementations are comprehensive - session windows especially are tricky to get right. The gap/4 checking frequency is a smart compromise between latency and CPU usage.

Switch connector gives content-based routing which covers a lot of partition use cases. AsyncMapper with ordered/unordered modes handles most parallel processing needs.

Major gap is aggregate - most stream processing needs some form of aggregation, but that would typically be application-specific anyway.

## How I Know

**Verification methodology:**
1. Glob search for `*.go` files, filtered out tests
2. Read each connector implementation to understand behavior
3. Analyzed function signatures and processing patterns  
4. Cross-referenced against common stream processing primitives
5. Examined Result[T] pattern implementation in result.go
6. Checked error handling patterns in error.go
7. Verified clock abstraction for testing support

**Evidence locations:**
- Core connectors: `/home/zoobzio/code/streamz/{fanin,fanout,mapper,filter,async_mapper}.go`
- Flow control: `/home/zoobzio/code/streamz/{throttle,debounce,sample,buffer}.go`
- Windowing: `/home/zoobzio/code/streamz/window_{tumbling,sliding,session}.go`
- Utilities: `/home/zoobzio/code/streamz/{tap,dlq,batcher,switch}.go`
- Foundation: `/home/zoobzio/code/streamz/{result,error,api,clock}.go`

**Architecture verification:**
- All Process() methods return `<-chan Result[T]` 
- Context cancellation handled consistently
- Error propagation via Result[T] pattern eliminates dual channels
- Metadata flow preserved through transformations
- Clock interface enables deterministic testing (uses clockz package)
