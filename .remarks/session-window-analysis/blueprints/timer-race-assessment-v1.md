# SessionWindow Timer Race Condition Assessment

**TECHNICAL BLUEPRINT: SessionWindow Race Condition Analysis**  
**Date:** 2025-09-02  
**Agent:** midgel (Chief Engineer)  
**Status:** CRITICAL DEFECTS IDENTIFIED - Redesign Required

---

## Executive Summary

**VERDICT: Major architectural flaw - requires complete timer management redesign**

The SessionWindow implementation contains a **fundamental race condition** in its timer management strategy that cannot be patched with the same simple fixes that worked for SlidingWindow. Unlike SlidingWindow, which had logical bugs in window assignment, SessionWindow has **concurrent access violations** in its timer lifecycle management that cause:

1. **Duplicate emissions** (extra windows created)
2. **Missing emissions** (sessions not timing out properly) 
3. **Incorrect session boundaries** (End times miscalculated)
4. **Data races** in timer map access

**Technical Assessment: REBUILD REQUIRED**  
**Risk Level: HIGH** - Production deployment would cause data corruption  
**Timeline: 2-3 days for complete redesign**

The issue is deeper than the SlidingWindow bugs because it involves **multiple goroutine coordination** around shared timer state, not just single-goroutine sequence logic.

## Critical Race Conditions Identified

### Primary Race: Timer Creation/Cancellation Conflict

**Location:** Lines 186-224 in `window_session.go`

```go
// RACE CONDITION: Multiple goroutines can execute this simultaneously
mu.Lock()
if session, exists := sessions[key]; exists {
    // Extend existing session with new Result
    session.Results = append(session.Results, result)
    session.End = now.Add(w.gap)
    
    // Stop existing timer
    if timer, ok := timers[key]; ok {
        timer.Stop() // RACE: Timer might fire between this and new timer creation
    }
} else {
    // Create new session
    sessions[key] = &Window[T]{...}
}

// Create new timer for session timeout
timer := w.clock.AfterFunc(w.gap, func() {
    mu.Lock()  // RACE: New timer firing while old timer being stopped
    defer mu.Unlock()
    // ... emit session
})
timers[key] = timer
mu.Unlock()
```

**Problem:** The gap between stopping old timer and starting new timer creates a window where:
- Old timer can fire during new timer creation
- Multiple timers can exist for same key simultaneously
- Timer callbacks can run concurrently with main processing loop

**Evidence from test failures:**
- `TestSessionWindow_BasicFunctionality`: Expected 2 sessions, got 3 (duplicate emission)
- `TestSessionWindow_SessionExtension`: Expected 1 session, got 2 (timer race during extension)

### Secondary Race: Session Boundary Calculation

**Location:** Lines 190, 201 in `window_session.go`

```go
session.End = now.Add(w.gap)  // Session extension
// vs
End: now.Add(w.gap),          // New session creation
```

**Problem:** Different goroutines see different `now` values, leading to inconsistent End times.

**Evidence:** `TestSessionWindow_WindowTimeBoundaries` expects session end at t+150ms, gets t+250ms

### Tertiary Race: Context Cancellation vs Timer Emission

**Location:** Lines 147-162 vs 217-221

```go
// Main loop context cancellation
case <-ctx.Done():
    for _, timer := range timers {
        timer.Stop() // RACE: Timer callbacks might still fire
    }
    for _, session := range sessions {
        if len(session.Results) > 0 {
            select {
            case out <- *session: // RACE: Competing with timer callbacks
            case <-ctx.Done():
            }
        }
    }
    
// Timer callback
timer := w.clock.AfterFunc(w.gap, func() {
    // RACE: Might execute after context cancellation started
    select {
    case out <- windowCopy: // RACE: Channel might be closed
    case <-ctx.Done():
    }
})
```

**Evidence:** `TestSessionWindow_ContextCancellation` expects 2 sessions, gets 1 (racing emission)

## Architecture Comparison: Why SessionWindow is Different

### SlidingWindow Success Pattern (Fixed)
```go
// Single goroutine processes all events sequentially
for {
    select {
    case result := <-in:
        // Process item atomically
        // No concurrent timer management
        // Time boundaries computed deterministically
    case <-ticker.C():
        // Emit windows atomically
        // No session-specific state to coordinate
    }
}
```

**Key Success Factors:**
- Single processing goroutine
- No dynamic timers per data item
- Stateless time boundary calculations
- No concurrent timer lifecycle management

### SessionWindow Failure Pattern (Current)
```go
// MULTIPLE concurrent execution paths:
// 1. Main processing goroutine
// 2. Timer callback goroutines (one per active session)
// 3. Context cancellation goroutine
// 4. Input channel closure handling

// Each path modifies shared state:
sessions := make(map[string]*Window[T])  // Shared map
timers := make(map[string]Timer)         // Shared map
var mu sync.Mutex                        // Shared lock

// Coordination failures:
// - Timer callbacks run outside main processing loop
// - Multiple timers can exist for same key during transitions
// - Session state modified from multiple goroutines
// - Channel emissions race between timer callbacks and main loop
```

**Key Failure Factors:**
- Multiple goroutines with shared mutable state
- Complex timer lifecycle (create/stop/recreate per event)
- Session state mutations from timer callbacks
- Race-prone cleanup during cancellation/close

---

## Why Simple Patching Won't Work

### SlidingWindow Fix Strategy (Successful)
```go
// Problem: Wrong window assignment logic
for start, window := range windows {
    if now >= start && now < window.End {  // WRONG: Missing future windows
        window.Results = append(window.Results, result)
    }
}

// Solution: Fix algorithm, same architecture
for start, window := range windows {
    if !start.After(now) && now.Before(window.End) {  // CORRECT
        window.Results = append(window.Results, result)
    }
}
// Add: Create new window if needed
```

**SlidingWindow was fixable because:** Single goroutine, algorithm bug, no concurrency issues

### SessionWindow Problem (Complex)
```go
// Problem: Architectural concurrency flaw
timer := w.clock.AfterFunc(w.gap, func() {
    // Callback runs in DIFFERENT goroutine
    mu.Lock()  // RACE with main processing
    // Modify shared state from callback
    select {
    case out <- windowCopy:  // RACE with main loop emissions
    }
})
```

**SessionWindow requires redesign because:**
- Fundamental concurrency model is flawed
- Cannot be fixed without changing timer strategy
- Race conditions are architectural, not algorithmic
- Multiple execution paths create coordination nightmare

---

## Recommended Architecture: Single-Goroutine Design

### Proposed Solution: Eliminate Timer Callbacks

```go
type SessionWindow[T any] struct {
    name    string
    clock   Clock
    keyFunc func(Result[T]) string
    gap     time.Duration
}

func (w *SessionWindow[T]) Process(ctx context.Context, in <-chan Result[T]) <-chan Window[T] {
    out := make(chan Window[T])
    
    go func() {
        defer close(out)
        
        sessions := make(map[string]*sessionState[T])
        ticker := w.clock.NewTicker(w.gap / 4) // Check 4x per gap for responsiveness
        defer ticker.Stop()
        
        for {
            select {
            case <-ctx.Done():
                w.emitAllSessions(sessions, out, ctx)
                return
                
            case result, ok := <-in:
                if !ok {
                    w.emitAllSessions(sessions, out, ctx)
                    return
                }
                w.processResult(result, sessions)
                
            case <-ticker.C():
                w.checkExpiredSessions(sessions, out, ctx)
            }
        }
    }()
    
    return out
}
```

**Key Architectural Changes:**

1. **Single Processing Goroutine:** All session management in one goroutine
2. **No Timer Callbacks:** Replace AfterFunc with periodic ticker checks
3. **Atomic Session Operations:** All mutations happen in main loop
4. **Deterministic Emission:** Only main goroutine emits windows
5. **Simple State Model:** Session state only modified from one place

### Implementation Details

```go
type sessionState[T any] struct {
    window     *Window[T]
    lastActive time.Time
}

func (w *SessionWindow[T]) processResult(result Result[T], sessions map[string]*sessionState[T]) {
    key := w.keyFunc(result)
    now := w.clock.Now()
    
    if state, exists := sessions[key]; exists {
        // Extend existing session
        state.window.Results = append(state.window.Results, result)
        state.window.End = now.Add(w.gap)
        state.lastActive = now
    } else {
        // Create new session
        sessions[key] = &sessionState[T]{
            window: &Window[T]{
                Results: []Result[T]{result},
                Start:   now,
                End:     now.Add(w.gap),
            },
            lastActive: now,
        }
    }
}

func (w *SessionWindow[T]) checkExpiredSessions(sessions map[string]*sessionState[T], out chan<- Window[T], ctx context.Context) {
    now := w.clock.Now()
    
    for key, state := range sessions {
        if now.After(state.window.End) {
            // Session expired - emit it
            select {
            case out <- *state.window:
                delete(sessions, key)
            case <-ctx.Done():
                return
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Benefits of This Design:**

1. **No Race Conditions:** Single goroutine = no coordination needed
2. **Deterministic Testing:** FakeClock advances work predictably
3. **Simple State Management:** All mutations atomic within select cases
4. **Easier Debugging:** Linear execution path, no callback hell
5. **Performance:** Periodic checking is more efficient than per-event timers

**Trade-offs:**
- **Latency:** Sessions timeout within one ticker interval (gap/4) instead of exact gap
- **Memory:** Slightly more memory usage during periodic checks vs immediate cleanup
- **Responsiveness:** Checking interval determines timeout precision

These trade-offs are **acceptable** for production because:
- Gap/4 checking still provides sub-second precision for typical gaps
- Memory usage is bounded by active sessions (same as before)
- Most applications can tolerate small timeout latency variations

## Integration Considerations

### Impact on Existing streamz Components

**No Breaking Changes Required:**
- `Window[T]` interface unchanged
- `Result[T]` pattern unchanged  
- `Clock` interface unchanged
- Public API signatures identical

**Internal Implementation Changes:**
- Timer management strategy completely different
- Goroutine model simplified
- Mutex usage eliminated
- Memory allocation pattern optimized

### Integration with Result[T] Pattern
```go
// Current pattern works perfectly with redesign
sessions := streamz.NewSessionWindow(
    func(result Result[UserAction]) string {
        if result.IsError() {
            return result.Error().Item.UserID  
        }
        return result.Value().UserID
    },
    streamz.RealClock,
)

// Process mixed success/error streams
userSessions := sessions.Process(ctx, actionResults)
for session := range userSessions {
    values := session.Values()    // Successful actions
    errors := session.Errors()    // Failed actions  
    successRate := float64(session.SuccessCount()) / float64(session.Count()) * 100
    // Analysis works exactly the same
}
```

**✅ Perfect compatibility** with existing Result[T] error handling patterns.

---

## Conclusion

The SessionWindow implementation contains **fundamental architectural flaws** that cannot be resolved through simple patching. Unlike the SlidingWindow, which had algorithmic bugs in a sound architecture, SessionWindow has **concurrent access violations** that require a complete redesign.

**Key Findings:**
1. **Current implementation is UNSAFE** for production use
2. **Race conditions are architectural**, not implementation bugs
3. **Redesign required** to match industry standards
4. **Single-goroutine model** is the only viable solution
5. **Implementation timeline: 2-3 days** for complete fix

**Final Assessment:** SessionWindow needs a **complete architecture redesign** using industry-standard single-goroutine patterns. The good news is that this redesign will eliminate all race conditions, improve testability, and align with how every major streaming framework implements session windows.

The redesign is **significantly more complex** than the SlidingWindow fix because it involves changing the fundamental concurrency model, not just fixing logic bugs. However, the resulting implementation will be **more reliable, testable, and performant** than the current approach.

**Production Readiness Timeline:**
- Current Implementation: **NEVER** (unsafe due to race conditions)
- Redesigned Implementation: **3 days** (complete architecture overhaul)

*Architecture Note: This analysis reveals why the SlidingWindow fix succeeded (single-goroutine algorithmic bug) while SessionWindow requires redesign (multi-goroutine architectural flaw). The lesson: when concurrency problems cannot be solved by adding locks, the architecture itself is wrong. SessionWindow proves that rule.*
